Items to do for multi root folder support

- check that nodePath is honored as a resource
- fetch settings for the resource
- add some typing to the tslint module

Done
- test with tslint 3
- remove workspace root references
    one reference in server.ts, the argument is optional, so it should be fine to remove the argument
    promise = server.Files.resolve('tslint', globalNodePath, workspaceRoot, trace);
